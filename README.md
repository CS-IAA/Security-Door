# Security-Door

A new simple security door system. The user has a simple ID (6 characters long and includes a capital letter), and a PIN that is 6 digits long. It will open a door and record when the door was opened and by whom. All incorrect entries are recorded as well. The ID and PIN are both salted and hashed.
